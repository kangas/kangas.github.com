<em>I have always wondered how Steve Jobs&#39; so-called reality distortion field worked, since its myth makes him seem supernatural.<br /><br />
However, if you spend enough time circulating, you start to see how it works. I encounter a lot of people pitching in my line of work. In fact, I spend a lot of time pitching too.</em>
<em><br /><br />
Some universal things I&#39;ve learnt that lead to getting people on board faster:</em>
<em><br /><br />
0. Listen, listen hard. Understand where the other person desperately needs to head next.</em>
<em><br /><br />
1. Paint a vision of the future that fulfills both parties&#39; desperate needs.</em>
<em><br /><br />
2. Be genuinely passionate about that vision. If you&#39;re passionate, it&#39;s easier for the other party to be passionate. It&#39;s also hard to be dishonestly passionate.</em>
<em><br /><br />
3. Turn that vision into immediately actionable steps.</em>
<em><br /><br />
4. Start moving yourself on your own commitments and lead that person into taking those steps.</em>
