<p>The just-released 1.1.0 API for Google App Engine contains a new "Imaging" library. Hooray! It works by providing stubs, which use <a href="http://www.pythonware.com/products/pil/">Python Imaging Library (PIL)</a> in development, and some-other-machine-behind-the-curtain when you deploy to Google.</p>

<p>So, if you're developing for App Engine, you now need PIL on your development system too. Google provides a <a href="http://code.google.com/appengine/docs/images/installingPIL.html">Installing PIL</a> document. Unfortunately, their directions re: OS X are not quite right:</p>

<ul>
<li>"Download the Mac installer from the <a href="http://pythonmac.org/packages/py25-fat/index.html">http://pythonmac.org</a>."</li>
<li>"Install the package"</li>
<li>"Finish the installation ..."</li>
</ul>

<p>Alas, that package will refuse to install if you are using the original Python interpreter that ships with Mac OS X.</p>

<p>After hitting this obstacle and wasting a half hour digging through obsolete HOWTOs, I found this nugget in the <a href="http://wiki.python.org/moin/MacPython/Leopard">pythonmac.org Leopard page</a>:</p>

<p><em>4. In Terminal, create a symbolic link for the system's Python.framework in the location expected by the pythonmac.org tools, like so:</em></p>

<pre><code>cd /Library/Frameworks
sudo ln -s /System/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/ Python.framework
</code></pre>

<p>Yes, you can skip steps 1-3 and jump directly to 4 if you <em>just</em> want to PIL, not IDLE or anything else. <strong>Now run</strong> the <a href="http://pythonmac.org/packages/py25-fat/index.html">PIL installer</a>. It should work!</p>

<p>You also need to add the PIL install location to <code>PYTHONPATH</code>. Stick the following in <code>~/.bashrc</code>.</p>

<pre><code>export PYTHONPATH=/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.5/lib/python2.5/site-packages/
</code></pre>

<p>Now open a new terminal window, and type:</p>

<pre><code>python -c "from PIL import Image"
</code></pre>

<p>If you don't see an error message, you're done. :)</p>
