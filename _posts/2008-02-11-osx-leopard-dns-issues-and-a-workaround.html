<p>Another tip for MacBook/MacBook Pro owners running OS X 10.5 "Leopard"...</p>

<h2>Problem Description</h2>

<p>For a little while, I've noticed what seemed to be occasional problems with Safari, the default web browser under OS X. I'll be browsing the web at home via WiFi when <strong>suddenly Safari says "You are not connected to the Internet" – but only for a certain (random) website</strong>. Other websites are still usable. My IM client suffers no interruption while this is happening, nor does Mail.app.</p>

<p>(Actually, I've seen wierdness with Mail.app too, where it fails to validate the SSL certificate for one or more of my email accounts. This may/may not be related... keep reading.)</p>

<p>This happens when I'm at home, using Time Warner cable via WiFI (Buffalo WHR-G125 re-flashed with DD-WRT Linux). I've seen TWC flakiness in the past, but my other Linux box running <a href="http://oss.oetiker.ch/smokeping/">Smokeping</a> wasn't showing network dropouts. Hmm.</p>

<h2>Background</h2>

<p>I went a-Googling yesterday, and found that I'm not the only person seeing these issues...</p>

<h2>How I'm dealing with it (so far)</h2>

<p>1) Turn off IPV6</p>

<ul>
<li>System Preferences » Network » Advanced » TCP/IP</li>
<li>"Configure IPV6: Off"</li>
</ul>

<p>Frankly, I cannot tell if this is having any effect at all.</p>

<p>2) Create a shell script called "<code>dns-flush</code>":</p>

<p><code>#!/bin/sh</code> <br />
<code>dscacheutil -flushcache</code></p>

<p>Make that file executable (<code>chmod u+x dns-flush</code>) and run it (<code>./dns-flush</code>) whenever Safari flakes out.</p>

<p><strong>This is helping!</strong> Safari immediately stops acting stupid and comes back to life. Unfortunately, I find that I need to run this once every few hours. Does anybody else have a better answer?</p>
