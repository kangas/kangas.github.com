<p>Wow, this gives me warm fuzzies, and <em>some</em> hope that the Internet will do the "right thing" after all -- even if it exhausts all other possibilities first. (<a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=churchill+America+counted+to+do+the+right+thing+-+after+having+exhausted+all+other+possibilities&amp;btnG=Search">Thank you Winston Churchill</a>)</p>

<p>In this case, I'm talking about making closed-technology "rich web interfaces" like Flash and Silverlight a thing of the past. The ability to click "View Source" in a web browser was one of the biggest reasons the web grew quickly, because any curious dabbler could see how a visual trick was achieved -- and then replicate it.</p>

<p>Awesome developments along this front:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>From the <a href="http://www.facebook.com/note.php?note_id=14218138919">Facebook Engineering Blog</a> - New Facebook Chat Feature Scales to 70 Million Users Using Erlang and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comet_(programming)">Comet</a>. That's a lot of users! Nice validation of Erlang as a scalable back-end for rich web UIs,</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://ejohn.org/blog/processingjs/">Processing.js from John Reisig</a> is a port of the <a href="http://ejohn.org/blog/overview-of-processing/">Processing visualization language</a> to JavaScript, using the <a href="http://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/HTML:Canvas">Canvas</a> element. Check out <a href="http://ejohn.org/apps/processing.js/examples/basic/">the demos</a> -- I'm stunned to see this kind of smooth animation being created with nothing more than JavaScript and standard HTML components. Wow!</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Why do these matter?</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Adobe has argued that if you want to build rich <em>dynamic</em> web UIs, you need Flash plus <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BlazeDS">BlazeDS</a> or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adobe_LiveCycle">LiveCycle</a> if you want it to scale. Facebook's announcement blows this argument out of the water.</p></li>
<li><p>Flash doesn't work on the iPhone. But the Processing.js demos will -- and every other device that has a WebKit or Mozilla-based browser, modulo an update or two.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Soon you'll be able to build a rich Flash-like interface that works on... iPhone, Google Android phones, Nokia Nseries, Asus EeePC and <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2008/01/09/asus-eeepc-spotted-running-splashtop-instant-on-os/">Splashtop</a> devices. And all without those companies paying a tax on every device for Flash or Silverlight runtimes!</p>

<p>This means a better platform for developers and cheaper, better gizmos for consumers. Hooray!</p>

<p>PS: Tie these goodies together and <a href="/p16/2008/01/madcap-idea-2-r.html">my Remote &lt;canvas&gt; Protocol proposal</a> from January is looking pretty feasible. :)</p>
