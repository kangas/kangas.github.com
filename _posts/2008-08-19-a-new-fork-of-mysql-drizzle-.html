<p>A friend just clued me into this <em>very</em> interesting fork of MySQL, spearheaded by someone inside the MySQL team (<a href="http://krow.livejournal.com/602409.html">Brian Aker</a>) and apparently with the <a href="http://monty-says.blogspot.com/2008/07/what-if.html">blessing of &quot;Monty&quot; Widenius</a></p>

<p><a href="http://drizzle.wikia.com/wiki/Drizzle_Features">Goals</a> include:</p>

<ul>
<li>Use UTF8 and InnoDB by default</li>
<li>Rip out everything that isn&#39;t absolutely necessary, including: stored procs, views, triggers, grants</li>
<li>Make the core as small as possible</li>
<li>Sharding across multiple nodes</li>
<li>Make it a &quot;real&quot; community project</li>
</ul>

<p>Neat! :)</p>

<p><a href="https://launchpad.net/drizzle">Code is on Launchpad</a> - it&#39;s a fork of the MySQL 6.0 codebase. They&#39;re aiming for something usable in a few months.</p>
