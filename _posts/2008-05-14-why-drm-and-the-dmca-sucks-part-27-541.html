<p>Dear Amazon.com,</p>

<p>You really should get out of the business of making e-book readers. Not that there's anything wrong with the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&amp;location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fkindle&amp;tag=p16prapro-20&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325">Amazon Kindle</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=p16prapro-20&amp;l=ur2&amp;o=1" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" />, your wireless reading device. But I don't want yet another gizmo to carry around. I want to read e-books on the devices I already have.</p>

<p>Please stop trying to build e-book readers. <strong>Instead, let other developers build them, legally</strong>. Let a thousand e-book readers bloom.</p>

<p>The Kindle uses an e-book format from your subsidiary <a href="http://www.mobipocket.com/">Mobipocket</a>. I bought an e-book from Mobipocket -- once. I read it on my Nokia E62 using the Mobipocket Reader for Symbian OS. It was a crappy experience. Oh, it was nice being able to read on the subway, one teeny screen at a time. But I would have much preferred to read on the larger screen of my <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/search?ie=UTF8&amp;keywords=nokia%20n810&amp;tag=p16prapro-20&amp;index=blended&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325">Nokia N810</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=p16prapro-20&amp;l=ur2&amp;o=1" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" />.</p>

<p>When I was done, I wanted to refer to some passages I'd highlighted. Ideally, I'd do this on my Macintosh laptop. Unfortunately, Mobipocket doesn't have reader software for the Mac (!?!?). So I wound up using <strong>VMWare</strong> to run a copy of Windows to... just look up a passage in that e-book.</p>

<p>That was an awful set of hoops that you made me jump through, Amazon.</p>

<p>Oh the ironies of this situation. Amazon has an <a href="http://www.amazon.com/b?%5Fencoding=UTF8&amp;site-redirect=&amp;node=163856011&amp;tag=p16prapro-20&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325">MP3 Download service</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=p16prapro-20&amp;l=ur2&amp;o=1" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" />, which offers <a href="http://www.eff.org/pages/customer-always-wrong-users-guide-drm-online-music">non-DRM'd music</a> unlike iTunes. But DRM copy-protection is exactly the thing that keeps me from reading that e-book on my N810 using <a href="http://tableteer.nokia.com/tableteer/os2008/feat_fbreader.xhtml">FBReader</a>.</p>

<p>Conflicting priorities:</p>

<ul>
<li>Mobipocket (and Amazon) don't have unlimited budgets to build and support e-book reader programs for every random gadget in the universe</li>
<li>The universe of pocket-size gadgets that <em>could</em> be e-book readers is expanding, not contracting</li>
<li>I would love to step into this fray and set things straight, but I don't want to become a <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=Dimitri%20Sklyarov">martyr like Dimitri Sklyarov</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Amazon -- you can fix this situation. <strong>Create a web service to decrypt Mobipocket e-books</strong>. Make it accessible to <strong>registered developers</strong> who sign a terms-of-use agreement and agree to take reasonable steps within their programs to prevent unauthorized copying.  Heck, you can even verify ownership of the e-book when the service is called.</p>

<p>You already have a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/aws">thriving web services business</a>. This should be a no-brainer for you.</p>

<p>If you don't want to invest in this right now -- heck, I'm willing to build this service and market it to e-book software makers, <strong>if and only if</strong> you provide me with legal indemnification so none of your publishers sue me under the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DMCA">DMCA</a>.</p>

<p>Because... even though this could be a really nice niche business, and it would clearly benefit the e-book and publishing industries if implemented, all I need is one publisher's lawyer with his knickers in a twist to make me a <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0110912/quotes">fuckin' grease spot</a>.</p>

<p>Until then, I'll stick to paper books.</p>
