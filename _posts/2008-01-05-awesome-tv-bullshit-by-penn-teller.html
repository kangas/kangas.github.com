<p>Maybe I'm the last person on the planet to discover this. But, I just found out yesterday that the magicians <a href="http://www.pennandteller.com/">Penn &amp; Teller</a> have a TV show on Showtime called "Bullshit!"</p>

<p><a href="http://bullshitlinks.blogspot.com/">Links to free episodes of Penn &amp; Teller: Bullshit!</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>"Penn &amp; Teller:Bullshit! aims to debunk an array of metaphysical, supernatural, and popular misconceptions and to apply critical thinking and scientific skepticism to these issues."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Dang, it's been on since 2003? I don't have Showtime so I suppose that's why I missed it. But... still. I've watched two episodes so far, and I've been seriously missing out.</p>

<p>The beauty of this show is its premise. You've got Penn &amp; Teller, a well-known magician duo on TV. What can they talk about? Magicians <em>never</em> give away their secrets, so they don't talk about magic. However, magicians are experts at fooling people.</p>

<p>So they talk about how people get fooled, fleeced, and otherwise scammed. And they show how the scams work. Awesome!</p>
