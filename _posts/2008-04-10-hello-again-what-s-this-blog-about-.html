<p>It's been a while since I've written anything for this blog. Sometimes I wonder, "what's the point of writing?" But I had a point, once. Let's review, for your sake and mine.</p>

<p>Hi, I'm Matt Kangas. I live in NYC and I call myself a "technical internet entrepreneur". That's short for: veteran of many internet startups, usually in a tech-lead/programmer role. The most well-known of those was Yahoo! HotJobs, which I left in 2005. The least well-known was probably my search startup, BusyTonight.com. (It's offline now. Sorry.)</p>

<p>For the longest time, I subscribed to Marc Andreessen's reason for not writing a blog: <a href="http://dannyman.toldme.com/2003/03/08/marc-andreessen-lacks-time-ego-need/">"I don't have the time or ego need"</a>. But then he started writing a blog <a href="http://blog.pmarca.com/">after all</a> -- and it's quite good!</p>

<p>So let's write. But to what end, and to whom am I writing?</p>

<p>I don't sit next to anyone in a cubicle. These days, I mostly work from home. But aside from the soul-sucking homogeneity of cube farms... one thing I miss about not being in an office is the conversations! We had a great team at HJ NYC, and it was so easy to bounce an idea off the guy in the cube next to you. To ask Alex about a research paper he just found. To kill a few minutes playing the Atari 2600 at Tom's desk. Or to plot our next step in world domination.</p>

<p>(Right!)</p>

<p>I loved chatting with those folks on a daily basis. But now we're scattered at places like Google (in Alex's case), AOL (in Tom's case), RightMedia (Max, Dave, Leland), and a bunch of smaller places. Like my living room. :)</p>

<p>So that's what my blog is about - chatting with colleagues. Strong ideas and good times. I will write as if I'm writing to my old friends, and I hope they tune in. But you, dear reader, are a colleague of mine too if you wish.</p>

<p>Welcome to the virtual cube farm. :) Now let's fire up my old <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=vectrex">Vectrex</a> and show that Atari 2600 what a real game system is like!</p>
