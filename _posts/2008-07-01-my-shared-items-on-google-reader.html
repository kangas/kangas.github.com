<p>I'm using Google Reader these days to follow various blogs. Anything that I want to keep for future reference I'm marking "shared" -- so you can see it too.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.google.com/reader/shared/14069802752144521003">Google Reader - matt kangas' shared items</a></p>

<p>If you're interested, you can subscribe to an RSS feed of that, too.</p>

<p>Maybe I should find a way to have these items auto-added to this blog?</p>
