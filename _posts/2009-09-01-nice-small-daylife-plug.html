<p>Very nice plug for me and my employer here. Thanks!</p>

<p><em><strong>Lie #3:  Aggregators are killing my business</strong></p>

<p>No they’re not.</p>

<p>This one drives me nuts.  Don’t blame Arianna, Tina, Larry and Sergey or all those Tweeple out there.  If anyone killed the newspaper business as we knew it, it was Craig Newmark.</p>

<p>People making this argument always forget that newspapers can be aggregators too.  As I asked earlier this week, why is there no HuffPo equivalent in the UK?</p>

<p>You don’t even need humans to do the aggregation.  Daylife, Evri, Inform et al will do it for you and in the case of Daylife in particular, brilliantly.
