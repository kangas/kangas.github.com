<p>Someone from the Wikia team finally came up for air on the Lucene mailing lists. It was Dennis Kubes, and aside from being really busy (as one might expect :), it sounds like they're trying to do the right things for the open-source community: publish their improvements back to the community, etc.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.nabble.com/Re%3A-Wikia-search-goes-live-today-p14701104.html">lucene-java: Dennis Kubes, "Re: Wikia search goes live today"</a> (<em>Nabble archive</em>)</p>

<p>An interesting detail:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>"Also the social networking functionality, named <strong>foowi</strong>, will become its own open source project (probably with an apache license)"</p>
</blockquote>

<p>"foowi", I like it! :)</p>

<p>Whilst searching Nabble for this to share, I happened upon an earlier message by Dennis asking about Wiki search, "Is anybody here working with that project or planning on working with it?". I can only assume that Jimbo Wales pinged Dennis personally sometime after Mar 25, 2007. :)</p>
