<p>I acquired a cool new toy yesterday -- courtesy of my lovely girlfriend Susan, and Warner Brothers, which gave it to her at the end of a business presentation (gotta love the ad business!).</p>

<p>It's a tiny handheld camcorder that records to internal solid-state memory, and has a USB plug on the side that pops out. Plug it into your computer and you'll find software (Windows and Mac) on the camera, ready to use.</p>

<p>The quality is really not so bad. Here is a quick clip of my dog, which I shot at 11PM last night, edited slightly, and <a href="http://flix55.com/watch/Bw4KWvpPEfk">uploaded to Flix55.com</a>:</p>

<p>Gads, I sound so silly talking to my dog! :-)</p>

<p>Some quick tech notes:</p>

<ul>
<li>The provided OS X software runs directly off the camera -- nothing to install</li>
<li>It's a PowerPC app, but it ran fine on my MacBook Pro (Rosetta emulation)</li>
<li>An MPEG4 codec from 3ivx.com is provided. I was able to play the videos without it, but I installed anyway</li>
<li>For sharing, the app will recode your video in a "Flip Videos for Uploading" format -- Quicktime .MOV (codecs: QDesign Music 2, Sorenson Video 3)</li>
<li>This "upload" version is a lot smaller, but <a href="http://flix55.com/watch/DY0UdfKwcgt">the audio transcodes poorly on websites that use ON2 Flix Engine to generate Flash video (FLV)</a> -- like Flix55.com</li>
</ul>

<p>ps: Yes, I set up the video transcoding backend at Flix55.</p>
