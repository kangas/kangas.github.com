<p>The top news in the search world today is that Jimmy Wales' much-hyped "Google killer", Wikia Search, just pulled back the covers today for the world to see:</p>

<p>http://alpha.search.wikia.com/</p>

<p><a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2008/01/06/wikia-search-is-a-complete-letdown/">Techcrunch called it a "complete letdown"</a>. That may be a bit harsh, but he's right, it's anything but a "Google killer" in its current form. Other writeups that I noticed include <a href="http://venturebeat.com/2008/01/06/search-wikia-launches-will-it-threaten-google/">VentureBeat</a>, <a href="http://www.alleyinsider.com/2008/01/wikias-googlekiller-launches-google-not-killed.html">Silicon Alley Insider</a>, and John Battelle's <a href="http://battellemedia.com/archives/004194.php">Searchblog</a></p>

<p>So after a <a href="http://searchengineland.com/061229-193718.php">year of hype</a>, what has Wikia actually built?</p>

<ul>
<li>It's clearly built on Apache <a href="http://lucene.apache.org/nutch/">Nutch</a> and <a href="http://lucene.apache.org/">Lucene</a></li>
<li>Click on a <a href="http://search.isc.swlabs.org/explain.jsp?idx=3&amp;id=296857&amp;query=beowulf">score link</a> and the Nutch logo is still displayed, as of today</li>
<li>It turns out that one of the Nutch committers, Dennis Kubes, has been (quietly) working on this project</li>
</ul>

<p>Alongside the Google-style results are boxes for:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>"People Matching <em>term</em>"</strong> - user profiles with pictures </li>
<li><strong>"Mini Article About <em>term</em>"</strong> - links to a MediaWiki instance at search.wikia.com</li>
</ul>

<p>In comments on the TechCrunch post, Jimmy Wales stressed that "It’s a project to <em>build</em> a search engine, not a search engine". I for one am glad they "released early", and can't wait to see where they're going with this. If they can actually make the "transparent index" that gives good results, it'll be a great service to internet users... more or less what Doug Cutting set out to do when he started the Nutch project.</p>

<p>(Disclosure: We used Nutch at my startup <a href="http://www.minger.net/2006/11/16/busytonight-–-the-long-tail-of-event-listings/">BusyTonight</a> for all of our crawl infrastructure from 2005 to 2007.)</p>
