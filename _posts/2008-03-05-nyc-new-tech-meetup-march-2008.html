"The Future of Organizing"</a></p>

<p>I've been subscribed to the <a href="http://newtech.meetup.com/1/">NY Tech Meetup</a> for several months, but I've never been able to get an RSVP until now. Woo! They had a pretty interesting lineup of speakers... different from their usual format, they invited folks from outside of NYC to present.</p>

<p>Below are my notes from the event.</p>

<hr />

<h3>Jordan Goldberg <a href="http://stickk.com">Stickk.com</a></h3>

<p>Binding users to "Committment Contracts": losing weight, quick smoking, any personal goal.</p>

<p>The users declare how much <strong>money</strong> is at stake if they fail to attain the goal, and select the (charity, anti-charity). Bills through PayPal!</p>

<p>Choose "Referee" - someone to verify progress. They get an email notification, then are responsible for verifying the accuracy of the user's weekly reports.</p>

<p>Choose "Supporter" - someone to cheer you on, also gets periodic emails.</p>

<p>"Inbox" tells user each action (committment, referee, supporter) they need to take for themselves &amp; others each week.</p>

<p>"Tagging committments" - helps people find other folks trying to achieve the same. "Giant AA meeting" :)</p>

<ul>
<li>Worked on it full-time since june 2007</li>
<li>hired a professional dev team</li>
<li>launched 1 month ago</li>
<li>6000 users</li>
<li>over $100k currently at stake, success rate at 80-90% range</li>
</ul>

<h3>Peter Dietz - <a href="http://socialactions.com/">Social Actions</a>, Montreal</h3>

<p>"Help build a mashup of 29+ social action platforms"</p>

<p>Interoperability between "social action platforms" (29+ identified to date):
sixdegrees.org, givemeaning, thepoint, change.org, firstgiving, fundable, razoo, helpalot, ...</p>

<ul>
<li>built using drupal (so far)</li>
<li>aggregates campaigns from social action platforms</li>
<li>search engine for (charity) campaigns</li>
<li>working to add apis that the "social action platforms" would use to publicize data for mashups and more</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<h3>Jesse Richards - <a href="http://meetup.com">Meetup.com</a> - "Pledges"</h3>

<p>Example: no Taoism meetups in Pittsburgh</p>

<p>User could start a meetup... but this is intimidating. Costs money, time.</p>

<p>Second option: sign up for a <strong>waiting list</strong>. Requests "pledges"</p>

<ul>
<li>Promise to attend the first meeting</li>
<li>I'll help organize</li>
<li>I can chip in money</li>
<li>I have an idea for our first meeting...</li>
</ul>

<p>Then you can see other people who have made matching pledges in this area. Little "I Pledged" banner under user's icon. :)</p>

<p>Helps eliminate hierarchy between group and one organizer.</p>

<p>Launched in November 1, 70k people pledged to date (Mar 4).</p>

<p>More waiting lists than groups. Easily 10x, 100x maybe.
"System for aggregating demand for community"</p>

<hr />

<h3>Paul Miller - <a href="http://schoolofeverything.com/">SchoolOfEverything</a> - London, UK</h3>

<p>"Everyone has something to learn, everyone has something to teach"</p>

<p>Inspiration: "The Free U" at Stanford, 60s... if you had something to teach, you posted a sheet on a bulletin board. (See book "The Dormouse ..." for info)</p>

<p>What do you want to learn? Search for teachers in the area. Any topic that is legal.</p>

<p>Existing sites for building, sharing curriculum:
- these guys are about brokering relationships</p>

<p>Feedback/reputation mechanism is what they're working on now (nothing in place yet)</p>

<p>Can organize classes on the site, but no way to see if there's demand for a class... yet.</p>

<hr />

<h3>Andrew Mason - <a href="http://thepoint.com/">ThePoint.com</a> - Chicago</h3>

<p>Inspiration: Started ~1yr ago, when he was canceling a cell-phone contract</p>

<p>Helps action groups reach critical mass (tipping point)... any kind of group action.</p>

<p>campaigns are:</p>

<ul>
<li>result-oriented</li>
<li>has defined goals (tipping action)</li>
<li>example: want to boycott KFC, need one million customers to sign up first</li>
</ul>

<p>many amusing campaigns</p>

<p>Can be used for fund-raising: "You pledge to contribute $X <em>WHEN</em> N people sign up"</p>

<p>"The Point is for... when every little bit does not count."</p>

<p>it's for finding out "how many people are needed to take X action, such that a company's policy will no longer exist"</p>

<p>Want to create a market for policy decisions in corporate behavior, and the cost (in people * action) to make it happen</p>

<hr />

<h3>Clay Shirky - <a href="http://shirky.com/herecomeseverybody/">HereComesEverybody (.org)</a> –– A BOOK</h3>

<p>"the power of organizing without organizations"</p>

<p>case studies: airplanes sitting on runways, users disgruntled, ... 1999 airlines could just wait it out, 2007 lawsuit succeeds. what changed?</p>

<p>case 2: "flashmobs", started in ny by guy who wanted to demonstrate how brainless hipster culture was!
- when it got to Belarus, "mass eating ice cream" ... <em>arrested</em> by secret service!. provoked gov't into real action.
- repeated to demonstrate to the world what life was like in Belarus
- when used in high-freedom environments, flashmobs look silly. but in low-freedom places, becomes way to undermine authority</p>

<p>case 3: stickers in palermo against mafia. some media exposure.
- then organized businesses online who refuse to pay off the mafia</p>

<p>"Media is moving from a source of information to a site of action"</p>

<hr />

<h3>Q&amp;A</h3>

<p>Q: How are they looking to measure results (effectiveness)</p>

<ul>
<li>schoolofeverything: people who meet each other, who wouldn't meet otherwise</li>
<li>stickk: success rates</li>
</ul>

<p>stickk: looking to add "group committments", where money goes into a pot and those who succeed get a cut of the pot (!)</p>

<p>Q: Have these guys approached the large incumbent charitable orgs to help the scale?</p>

<ul>
<li>"meetup alliance" is for this</li>
<li>stickk: people donate to charties upon failure, so yes, they're pursuing</li>
</ul>
