<p>Here are the slides to a talk I gave last night at the <a href="http://webtechny.com/">WebTechNY</a> User Group</p>

<p><a href="http://docs.google.com/Present?docid=dgfsrdhz_0qt78vnc5&amp;skipauth=true">Google App Engine - WebTechNY Aug 2008 - Google Docs</a></p>

<p>The audience was mostly HTML/CSS developers, not the seasoned server-side developers that Google&#39;s own App Engine docs presume, so my pitch was very introductory-level.</p>

<p>Considering that I finished the slide deck at 4PM and my talk started at 6:30PM, I didn&#39;t really want to advertise this much. :) Still, and in spite of it being August, I think we had 17 people in the audience. Several folks peppered me with some very astute questions. Privacy, whether to trust Google to our data, was a big concern. I told them my personal opinion on the matter -- but I am not a lawyer, so please use your own judgment.</p>

<p>I met Ashod, the founder of the WebTechNY user group, at the NYC App Engine &quot;hackathon&quot; back in (May?). He was enthusiastic but seemed a bit out of his element, so I tried to help him. I must have impressed him somehow as being an expert, so this talk is the result. :)</p>
