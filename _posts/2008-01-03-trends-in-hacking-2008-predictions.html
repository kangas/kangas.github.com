<p>Following up on my last post, what "web hacking" trends are coming in this new year?</p>

<p>Two obvious picks – because they've already been announced:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.engadget.com/2007/10/17/apple-planning-iphone-sdk-for-february/">iPhone native apps</a> – official SDK slated for Spring 2008</li>
<li><a href="http://code.google.com/android/">Google Android</a> mobile platform, jump-started by their <a href="http://code.google.com/android/adc.html">developer challenge</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Android looks like it will be a great little platform for app innovation. It won't be on billions of phones  just yet in 2008, but I suspect that <em>every now-shipping Linux handheld</em> will adopt it sometime this year. It just makes too much sense: why not adopt a JVM (<a href="http://code.google.com/android/what-is-android.html">Dalvik</a>) that actually runs well on handhelds?</p>

<p>As that occurs, I predict that <strong>Java ME development will decline</strong>, because sane developers will finally admit that <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_ME">Java ME</a> is <a href="http://www.oreillynet.com/onjava/blog/2007/11/dalvik_googles_tweaked_nonstan.html#comment-1827724">lame and crippled</a>. <a href="http://www.oreillynet.com/onjava/blog/2007/11/dalvik_googles_tweaked_nonstan.html">JCP shills</a> will wail and gnash their teeth as the world moves on.</p>

<p>Another clear trend – <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/">Amazon Web Services</a> <strong>will continue to kick ass in 2008</strong>. Last year, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/browse.html?node=201590011">EC2</a> was just a bit too bleeding-edge to be widely adopted. <a href="http://radar.oreilly.com/archives/2007/12/amazon_launches.html">SimpleDB</a> and other developments will smooth out the rough edges, making it a no-brainer for startups to <strong>pick AWS first</strong> for web hosting. Then after startups, corporate IT will follow.</p>

<p>That's all I can think of right now. What other trends are clearly coming to fruition in 2008 which every web hacker should pay attention to?</p>

<p><em>Update</em> – Here's a sweet analysis on <a href="http://www.betaversion.org/~stefano/linotype/news/110/">Dalvik vs Java ME licensing</a> issues. But this isn't <em>totally</em> new: the T-Mobile Sidekick (<a href="http://danger.com/">Danger Hiptop</a>) also uses a non-standard JVM under the hood. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_Rubin">Andy Rubin</a> was responsible for both devices.</p>
