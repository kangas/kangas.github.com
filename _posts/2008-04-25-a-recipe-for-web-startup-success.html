<p>This week several big-name pundits spoke up about what, if you're running a web startup, one should do to prosper:</p>

</ul>

<p>Fine, do those things. Buy a fancy espresso machine and cheap desks and nice chairs and 2nd monitors. Lots of distractions gone. Then what? <strong>What do you focus on?</strong></p>

<p>Marc Andreessen has claimed, <a href="http://blog.pmarca.com/2007/06/the-pmarca-gu-2.html">"the only thing that matters is getting to product/market fit"</a>. I agree -- but <strong>how do you achieve this?</strong></p>

<p>You have an idea for a web startup. You want to build it, and you want it to be a big success. <strong>Where do you start?</strong></p>

<p>I'm not as famous as these guys, but I've seen many web startups up-close. I've had my skin in the game. I even just had an old friend ask for my opinion about it this week.</p>

<p>So here's my answer.</p>

<h2>One recipe for web-startup success</h2>

<p>Take your awe-inspiring, world-changing idea. Apply Occam's Razor ruthlessly, stripping away every aspect that is not essential. Keep cutting until you arrive at a <strong>core value proposition for users</strong> -- the reason anyone will care. Now design the <strong>simplest possible website</strong> that actually delivers this promise. Describe the <strong>whole</strong> website as <strong>closed-circuit</strong> -- no undefined link destinations.</p>

<p>Pare it down again and again. Can you see the entire web site in your head yet? Every navigation element, every piece of content? Nope? Then keep cutting.</p>

<p>You want a <strong>complete, coherent design for the simplest-possible website</strong> that delivers on your value proposition. </p>

<p>When you can finally describe the whole damn product in a handful of page-sketches, and how every UI element should behave -- only then should you:</p>

<ul>
<li>Build it (yourself, or hiring people)</li>
<li>Start promoting it</li>
<li>Run like hell</li>
</ul>

<p>Why? Because you want to save money! And you want to get to product/market fit as quickly as possible!</p>

<p>Writing code takes time. If it's not your time, it's someone else's and you're paying the bill. Save time and money <em>by writing less code</em>. Debug less code <em>by having less code</em>. Get to market fast <em>by knowing what to build</em>. Verify your idea in the marketplace faster <em>using a real implementation in a real timeframe</em>.</p>

<p>Nearly every startup I've ever seen tries to avoid this process. It's easier to just start building something. Hire a team, let them figure out the details. Action feels good! The problem is, I've never seen this work -- <em>not once</em>. The missing pieces never fall into place on their own.</p>

<p><strong>Plant the wrong seed, grow the wrong roots.</strong> Simple as that.</p>

<p>If you're having trouble getting to a radically stripped-down vision of the product, you could try:</p>

<ul>
<li>use-case specifications</li>
<li>wireframe mockups</li>
<li>"build one to throw away"</li>
</ul>

<p>But these are just "planning tools". They're only good helping you when you hit a dead-end mentally. They are not a substitute for the end result -- a radically actionable plan.</p>

<p>And... If you never get to the radically stripped-down plan that is actionable and would be valuable to users on day #1 -- maybe it's just not worth building. Seriously.</p>
