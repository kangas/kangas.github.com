<p>Someone asked me a rather interesting question today, and I'd like to share it (and my reply) with you.</p>

<p>Imagine you're in charge of a internet startup. You haven't launched yet, but the product is coming together and you'll be launching and promoting it soon. Everyone on your small team is working flat-out and doesn't have a second to spare for anything. At. All.</p>

<p>In one of those seconds you didn't have to spare, you think, "How do I ensure our website is secure?" So you don't have a big, gaping security breach on your shiny-new webapp the moment it gets some positive press?</p>

<p>Usually the answer is "Ack! I don't have time for this!" and you move on. Maybe you cross your fingers the next time the thought crosses your mind.</p>

<p>If you happened to be product manager within Yahoo!, instead of a startup, you'd have access to a wonderful resource: the "Paranoids". They're a highly experienced security assessment team who can quickly and clearly spell out best practices, find the booby-traps in your code, and smack your developers' wrists when necessary.</p>

<p>Alas, Yahoo still hasn't bought your startup yet. What now?</p>

<p>Here's how I replied:</p>

<p><em>I believe that one of the top guys from the Y! Paranoids team while I was there is now available for consulting. George Neville-Neil, <a href="http://www.neville-neil.com/">http://www.neville-neil.com/</a> . He's also known as gnn@freebsd.org and is a key FreeBSD contributor. He definitely won't be your typical time-wasting consultant.</em></p>

<p><em>The other name that came to mind was L0pht, the old hacker group from Boston. They turned it into a real company, which ultimately swallowed by Symantec, but it seems like a few of the guys behind it have moved on and founded another company, <a href="http://www.veracode.com/">Veracode</a> which does automated security audits. Competitors in that space include <a href="http://www.coverity.com/">Coverity</a>, <a href="http://www.fortify.com/">Fortify</a> and <a href="http://www.ouncelabs.com/">Ounce Labs</a>. Perhaps one of these will be useful?</em></p>

<p>By the way, I found that latter list of companies in this retrospective on the L0pht folks. It's a good read.</p>
