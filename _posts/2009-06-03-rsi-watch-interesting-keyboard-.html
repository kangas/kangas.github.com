title: RSI watch&#58; Interesting keyboard?

<p>Speaking of RSI as a workplace hazard, I stumbled across a link to this keyboard recently:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.typematrix.com/"><img src="/images/99D7C498-9FB5-44EA-89B3-184BB004C124.jpg" border="0" width="640" height="264" /></p>

<p>The TypeMatrix keyboard</p>
</a>

<p>Wild, eh?</p>

<p>My first bout with RSI was circa 1994, when I was an engineering co-op. I resolved that by giving up typing for six months. It worked, but I seriously wondered if I would have to consider not working with computers.</p>

<p>After my first real job out of school, I started encountering hand pain again, so I went through a phase of using strange keyboards, hoping one of these would fix the problem. I went through a <a href="http://www.kinesis-ergo.com/contoured.htm">Kinesis Ergo Contour</a> and a few other odd keyboards, before I realized that my real problem was my posture, and that was easily resolved with a proper keyboard tray.</p>

<p>For the last few years I've used a <a href="http://www.macally.com/en/Product/ArticleShow.asp?ArticleID=147">MacAlly IceKey Slim keyboard</a> at home and at work. It's cheap and feels similar to the MacBook Pro keyboard, which makes it easier to switch from desktop to laptop and back.</p>

<p>This TypeMatrix keyboard addresses one of my biggest gripes about modern keyboards: the number pad. If you're a right-handed mouse user, you have to put the mouse waaay off to the right -- and kink your wrist at an angle, which is bad to do for any extended period of time.</p>

<p>Or... you get a keyboard try with a mouse pad that can cover up the keyboard numkeys. Or take a Sawzall to your keyboard and chop the numpad off, and hope you don't lop off any important circuits in the process!</p>

<p>The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Happy_Hacking_Keyboard">Happy Hacking Keyboard</a> does a nice job of addressing this problem too. I've never owned one of 'em, but I do periodically wonder if it would be useful. Prior to my RSI problems, I was a fan of the "clacky" <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_M_Keyboard">IBM Model M keyboard</a>. I've still got one! It's great so long as (a) you don't touch the mouse much, and (b) sit in a soundproof cage so your coworkers won't hate you for making so much noise. :)</p>

<p>PS! If you're suffering from RSI, please read the <a href="http://www.tifaq.org/">Typing Injury FAQ</a>. It's a wonderful resource. Thanks to <a href="http://www.jwz.org/gruntle/wrists.html">jwz</a> for pointing me in this direction some years ago.</p>
