<p>There has been a <em>whole</em> lot of chatter on the interwebs re: the future of <a href="http://delicious.com">delicious.com</a> since yesterday, starting with <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2010/12/16/is-yahoo-shutting-down-del-icio-us/">a Techcrunch story</a> and spilling over onto HN, Twitter, <a href="http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/rip_delicious_you_were_so_beautiful_to_me.php">ReadWriteWeb</a>, etc.</p>

<p>We now have <a href="http://blog.delicious.com/blog/2010/12/whats-next-for-delicious.html">an official blog response about this story</a>, now, about 24 hrs too late. And it doesn't dispel the idea that Yahoo! actually wants to close Delicious. Instead, it sounds like whitewashing.</p>

<p>This sucks. I've used Delicious to store and share my bookmarks for a very long time, and I'm always surprised when someone mentions that they follow my bookmarks feed to see what I've been reading. (old friends living across the country, etc).</p>

<p>I could stick around, but now that I know the product is being neglected, I'll take my bookmarks elsewhere. Pinboard.in looks like a nice solution.</p>

<p>Old: <a href="http://delicious.com/kangas">http://delicious.com/kangas</a></p>

<p>New: <a href="http://pinboard.in/u:kangas">http://pinboard.in/u:kangas</a></p>

<p>Pinboard is getting slammed with new traffic today, so it will take a little time for that "New" URL to fill out. That's fine by me. I can wait for Pinboard to catch up on the flood of new users.</p>

<p>But I won't wait for Yahoo to EOL Delicious. I'd rather leave on my own terms, thank you very much.</p>
