<p><a href="http://biz.yahoo.com/ap/080201/microsoft_yahoo.html">Microsoft just made an unsolicited offer to buy Yahoo! for $31 a share</a>. Yesterday, YHOO was trading for $19/share, so that's one heck of a premium for shareholders. It's going to be very hard for Yahoo's board to turn this offer down.</p>

<p>The talking heads on Bloomberg and MSNBC are gushing praise for this deal. Credible folks in the web space like <a href="http://avc.blogs.com/a_vc/2008/02/you-had-to-see.html">Fred Wilson</a> and <a href="http://searchengineland.com/080201-064343.php">Danny Sullivan</a> are more measured in their response, but still sounding positive, from a financial perspective.</p>

<p>I'm going to ignore the dancing dollar signs in front of everybody's eyes, and focus on things less tangible: open source, web developers, and the soul of the web. If you care about those things, today is a sad day.</p>

<p>(FYI: I worked for HotJobs.com, which became Yahoo! HotJobs, from 2001 to 2005)</p>

<p>Why? I'll leave the weepy details for a later post, but in short: Microsoft sucks at the web because Microsoft thinks in terms of command-and-control, which is the antithesis of the web.</p>

<p>Putting Yahoo! inside of Microsoft is kinda <strong>like putting the Woodstock Festival, Jimi Hendrix and all, inside of the Kremlin</strong>. Maybe it was going to die off eventually on its own, but you <em>know</em> the life will be snuffed out now!</p>
