<p>Woo! Another alternative to <a href="http://wiki.apache.org/lucene-hadoop/">Hadoop</a> crawls out of Nokia Labs:</p>

<p><a href="http://discoproject.org/">Disco - discoproject.org</a></p>

<p>It's yet another <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MapReduce">Map-Reduce framework</a>. This time the core is written in Erlang, and tasks are implemented in Python. Data transfer between nodes happens simply via HTTP.</p>

<p>There's no DFS implemented at all yet. It seems intended to run on Amazon EC2, where you'd just use S3 as your data store.</p>

<p>This feels like it might be a good fit for our needs, since <a href="http://daylife.com/">we're</a> a Python shop, and I'd rather hack on Erlang than Java. :)</p>
