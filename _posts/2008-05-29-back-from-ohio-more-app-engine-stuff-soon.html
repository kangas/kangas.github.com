<p>I just arrived back in NYC from an extended Memorial Day weekend at my brother's place in Ohio. It was a good trip, but being offline since Friday was tough on my inbox... ;-)</p>

<p>Some good personal news: I'm starting a new job shortly. I don't want to jinx it before the contract is signed, but it's a good team in NYC working on a nifty product, quite aligned with my previous work at BusyTonight. I'll happily spill more details to you shortly.</p>

<p>While I was gone, Google made <a href="http://googleappengine.blogspot.com/2008/05/announcing-open-signups-expected.html">three awesome announcements</a> about App Engine:</p>

<ul>
<li>New APIs: Image manipulation and Memcache. Hooray! These are hugely helpful.</li>
<li>Expected pricing tiers, effective later this year -- helps you plan if App Engine is economical for your app</li>
<li>Open Signups - no more waiting in line to register!</li>
</ul>

<p>I'm also hoping to roll out a <strong>really</strong> quick-and-dirty "MediaWiki clone on App Engine" soon. Source and one wiki instance will be publicly available.</p>
