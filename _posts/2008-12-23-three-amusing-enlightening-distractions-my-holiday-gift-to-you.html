<p>Dear Reader,</p>

<p>Happy holidays! Whether you're celebrating Christmas, Hannukah, Kwanzaa, or anything at all, I hope you find some seasonal cheer in these weeks.</p>

<p>My gift to you for the holidays -- a few links for your enjoyment:</p>

<ol>
<li><p><a href="http://sneer.org/archives/2008/09/16/why_cal_hates_django/">(video) Why Cal Henderson hates Django</a></p>

<p>This is the keynote address from Django Con 2008 by the lead engineer from <a href="http://flickr.com">Flickr</a>. The title is tongue-in-cheek -- of course he doesn't <em>really</em> hate Django or Python, but he makes a good pretense of it. Hilarious and educational!</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://xark.typepad.com/my_weblog/2005/10/jimmy_wales_on_.html">(quote) Jimmy Wales on steak knives</a></p>

<p>One quick quote from Jimbo Wales, founder of Wikipedia, from ConvergeSouth in Greensboro, N.C. on Oct. 8. A rather fascinating perspective on "security" in the context of "social software"... I'll bet Facebook has never thought about security in this way.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/12/22/opinion/22gup.html">NY Times Op-Ed: Hard Times, a Helping Hand</a></p>

<p>The story of one man's generosity in the depths of the Great Depression, 75 years ago, in a small Midwest town you've probably never heard of -- which just happens to be my hometown. :-)</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Please consider giving to those in need this holiday season. There are lots of people hurting out there this year, and even little generosity can put a smile on someone's face.</p>

<p>Stay safe in your travels, and I'll see you in the new year!</p>
