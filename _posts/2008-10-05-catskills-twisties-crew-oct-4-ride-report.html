<p>I haven't ridden my motorcycle much this year, but on Saturday I met up with some folks from the <a href="http://motorcycle.meetup.com/3/boards/thread/5477724/">Brooklyn Motorcycle Meetup</a> for a long group ride through the Catskills.</p>

<p>12 hours in the saddle! 320 miles on the odometer! We froze our butts off in the morning, but we were rewarded with amazing twisties, and amazing views of just-turning fall foliage. Plus there was a huge BMW rally happening at Hunter Mountain, which we visited briefly.</p>

<p>FYI for celebrity watchers -- I'd swear we saw <a href="http://www.bravotv.com/Tabathas_Salon_Takeover/season/1/about/index.php">Tabatha Coffey</a> while we were having lunch at "Sweet Sue's" in Phoenicia, NY. But I'm probably mistaken. :)</p>
