<p>Dear readers - my apologies for posting so lightly as of late. I suppose I should come up for air more often, even if I'm enjoying my work.</p>

<p>Some things going on in NYC this week:</p>

<p>1) <a href="http://en.oreilly.com/webexny2008/public/content/home">Web 2.0 Expo New York 2008</a>. Not planning to go; I don't feel like dropping $1k for a conference right now. However, the one session I would <em>love</em> to see is Joshua Schacter's <a href="http://webexny2008.crowdvine.com/talks/show/1027">presentation on del.icio.us</a>. Wednesday Sept 17 at 1:20 PM.</p>

<p>2) <a href="http://www.mobaganda.com/couchdbtechtalkarc90-20080916">CouchDB tech talk @ Arc90</a> - tonight at 6pm. I'm interested, but I want to ride my bike home tonight so I'll probably pass.</p>

<p>3) <a href="http://blogs.s60.com/seeintos60/2008/08/an_evening_with_s60_in_new_yor.html">An evening with S60 in New York</a>. Weds Sept 17 at the Nokia Store in NYC (57th St). This is critical for Nokia fans -- count me in for sure! :)</p>

<p>ps: I upgraded my phone to a <a href="http://europe.nokia.com/e71">Nokia E71</a> about a month ago, and I'm loving it. Nothing against the iPhone 3G, but I like this better. If you like Nokia devices and haven't read <a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/items/2008/08/22.html">Joel on software's review of the E71</a> -- take a moment to read, it's priceless!</p>
