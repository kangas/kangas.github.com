<p>Dear readers - I haven't posted much recently because I've been busy starting a new job. The company is <a href="http://mystrands.com/">MyStrands.com</a>, the NYC office is still under construction, and my boss is <a href="http://www.mystrands.com/corp/bios/peyman_faratin.vm">this fellow</a>.</p>

<p>The project I'm on is in early stealth-mode. All I can tell you so far is that it's <em>not</em> the MyStrands music recommender product, it's something new and very promising. And there's a good chance that I will be using Erlang for some part of it. :)</p>

<p>This weekend I will be at <a href="http://barcamp.pbwiki.com/BarCampNYC3">BarCampNYC3</a>. Please stop by and say "hi"!</p>

<p>I'll be giving a presentation, like all BarCampers, probably a show-and-tell of how I set up the <a href="http://lucene.apache.org/solr">Apache Solr</a> search engine for <a href="http://flix55.com/">Flix55.com</a>.</p>

<p>Event: BarCampNYC3 <br />
Begins: March 15, 2008 at 11:00 am ET <br />
Ends: March 16, 2008 at 6:00 pm ET</p>

<p>Location: <br />
Polytechnic University <br />
6 Metrotech Ctr <br />
Brooklyn, NY 11201</p>
