<p>(If it looks like a turbine, do I want to dive in??)</p>

<p>I've previously mentioned <a href="/2008/04/google-app-engi.html">how much I like</a> the idea of Google App Engine. It's a neat model for web service hosting, and it promises to be really cheap. But considering that it's brand-new and unproven, I was happy to sit on the sidelines and let the rest of the market help shake out the bugs. Certainly, I wouldn't recommend it to any client just yet.</p>

<p>But I just found out that Google is hosting <a href="http://code.google.com/events/hackathons/appengine-ny.html">a hack-a-thon in their New York office</a> next Wednesday. It's a free, all-day event. Hmm! So I signed up. I haven't gotten my App Engine trial account yet, but I can probably fix that onsite.</p>

<p>As luck would have it, I have been cobbling together a new personal site project this last month. I was using PHP with Kohana and CouchDB -- none of which are usable in the GAE environment. I'll have to rewrite in Python using Google's own datastore. But aside from this one-time cost, my project seems like a good fit for the App Engine environment -- especially since the hosting is free for now.</p>

<p>Two major GAE limitations which will bite me:</p>

<ul>
<li>No way to resize image uploads. (No GD, no PIL.) Doh!</li>
<li>There is <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/google-appengine/browse_thread/thread/ba4a4a4ccefb96c5/0e3f0ab63c4c8afd">some support for full-text search</a>, but it's a crude hack for the moment.</li>
</ul>

<p>I absolutely need these for my project. But... phooey, I'm just going to dive right in anyway. Worst case, I can run a standalone image-resizer thingy on Amazon or maybe Slicehost until Google sorts this out. Plus it will be fun to beat some Googlers up about this next week. :)</p>
